Added basic functionality and example data.
  * Viewing all bins at /bins
  * Clicking on a bin to view its requests at /bins/:id/view
  * Clicking on a request to display tabs for headers, body, and query
    parameters if these are present, each of which can be clicked
    on to view the relevant data
  * Sorting bins by most recent request and requests by time
  * Code to talk to the API has been partially added but is currently
    disabled and replaced by functions that supply example data
